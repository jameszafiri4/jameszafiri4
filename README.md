Hello, my name is James Zafiri.
I currently work at Fidelity Investments as an analyst. I've been here since I finished my bachelor's degree in 2021.
I recently obtained my master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.
I’m looking to begin my career as a software engineer as soon as possible.

This account will be used to store my code from graduate school, as well as personal projects I'll be working on
